    A website designed and developed to feature an acquaintance's artworks.

    Note: Ask for permission before you use the images somewhere else. 

    This project is inspired based on another website's slide functionality, see here:  

    More importantly, the main functionalities for this project:

    1) Using Cloudinary API, to automatically display images based on the url from the Content Delivery Network (CDN).

    2) Using Imagga API to extract primary and secondary colors of the images. 

    3) Determine luminance of the background color, to assign a contrasting font color for readability of the text.
