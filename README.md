    A website designed and developed to feature an acquaintance's artworks.

    Note: Ask for permission before you use the images somewhere else. (Message her at: https://www.instagram.com/eell63909) 

    This project is inspired based on another website, to which I'll link later. 

    More importantly, one of the main functionalities I want to employ for this project are the following:

    1) Using npm cloudinary library, so that the artist can just freely upload her artwork's in cloudinary, which will be 
    rendered automatically by the website using this library.

    2) Using color picker by lodesh lakar, so that when a user clicks on an image, it would get the primary color used in the artwork, which would be used as a background color to display the details about it. 

    3) Use luminance, to use either a black or white color in the details section contrast to the primary color used in the background. 

    For now, I'm having issues with using the cloudinary library. I can get the images via node.js environment and running "node filename.js" command in the terminal, but I'm having CORS error when I run the code in the browser.

    However, according to my research, I can work around this by using a module bundler like webpack so I can run my javascript modules for cloudinary, in the browser. Those are the major challenges for now.

    I'll update this README.md if I was able to solve these things.
